# techstyle

An opinionated stylesheet for quickly building web apps that look "good enough to use"

## Goals

* Focused on apps more than documents
* No thinking about little details like fonts, colors, spacing, variants, etc.
* A bare minimum number of layout primitives to choose from
* A few parameters that can _optionally_ be customized - ideally the params can be randomly chosen and look decent most of the time

## Why "techstyle"?

It's a pun on textile. My last name, _Mercer_, comes from a word meaning "a textile merhant", so this is a way of living up to that heritage. ðŸ˜†
